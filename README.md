GeoContract

ABOUT

GeoContract is a web app that allows users to register as a service provider, consumer, or both. The app's interface allows users to register and then perform a search for a service provider under a specific category (i.e., electrician, plumber, dog walker, etc.), get their realtime geolocations, and instantly connect and instant message for service requests.
